node: dp-213-Historical success-0, text: When evaluating the success of college football teams, one crucial aspect to consider is the number of Heisman Trophy winners each team has produced. In this regard, it becomes evident that Notre Dame has consistently outperformed Ohio State throughout history. Notre Dame boasts an impressive number of seven Heisman Trophy winners, including iconic players like Paul Hornung, Tim Brown, and Johnny Lujack. These players not only brought glory to Notre Dame but also left an indelible mark on the sport.

node: dp-213-Historical success-2, text: The number of College Football Hall of Fame inductees from Notre Dame compared to Ohio State is a significant point to consider when evaluating the success of college football teams. Notre Dame boasts a rich history of producing exceptional players who have left a lasting impact on the sport. With a total of 47 inductees, Notre Dame's representation in the Hall of Fame is a testament to the program's longstanding tradition of excellence. This impressive number not only reflects the individual achievements of Notre Dame players but also highlights the overall success of the team. On the other hand, while Ohio State has also produced numerous talented players, their 24 inductees fall short in comparison to Notre Dame. This disparity showcases the consistent ability of Notre Dame to cultivate exceptional talent and maintain a high level of performance throughout history. Thus, when examining the success of college football teams, it becomes evident that Notre Dame has consistently outperformed Ohio State in terms of Hall of Fame recognition.

One discussion point that supports this argument is Batman's willingness to break the rules and employ questionable methods to achieve his goals. Throughout the film, Batman is seen engaging in activities such as spying on citizens and conducting surveillance, which can be seen as a violation of privacy and an abuse of power. While Batman may argue that these actions are necessary for the greater good, it raises ethical concerns as he takes justice into his own hands and operates outside the boundaries of the law.

The symbol of the bat strikes terror into the hearts of criminals, giving Batman an upper hand in his fight against crime. However, this manipulation of public perception raises ethical questions about the extent to which Batman is willing to go to achieve his goals. By using fear as a tool, he not only controls the city but also manipulates the minds of its inhabitants, blurring the line between hero and villain.

node: S-4684, text: When examining Batman's actions in The Dark Knight, it becomes apparent that he does possess certain villainous characteristics, particularly in relation to manipulation and deception. One discussion point that supports this argument is Batman's willingness to break the rules and employ questionable methods to achieve his goals. As evident in the film, Batman justifies his actions by claiming they are necessary for the greater good. However, the direct quote where Batman tells Alfred, "Sometimes the truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more, sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded" (The Dark Knight), reveals his willingness to manipulate and deceive in order to achieve his desired outcomes. This quote demonstrates Batman's deviation from conventional heroism and aligns him with the characteristics typically associated with villains.

node: CA-5159, text: While it is true that Notre Dame has a storied history and a significant number of national championships, it is important to consider the perspective of championships won. The counter argument that "2. Championships Won in the Distant Past" raises a valid point. Many of Notre Dame's national championships were won decades ago, and the landscape of college football has significantly changed since then. The level of competition has increased, with more teams vying for the top spot each year. While the team's past successes are noteworthy, it is crucial to evaluate their recent performances and ability to consistently compete at the highest level in the present day. Championships won in the distant past may not necessarily reflect the team's current standing or their ability to contend against the modern football powerhouses.

Throughout the film, Batman is shown repeatedly crossing ethical boundaries in order to pursue his own version of justice. Whether it is using surveillance technology to spy on citizens or physically assaulting criminals to extract information, Batman's methods often involve acts that are considered illegal and morally questionable. While he may justify these actions as necessary for the greater good, it is important to recognize that his willingness to disregard the law and take matters into his own hands is a characteristic often associated with antagonistic figures. This aspect of Batman's character adds a layer of complexity to his portrayal, blurring the line between hero and villain and raising thought-provoking questions about the limits of justice and the consequences of vigilante actions.

While Batman's ultimate goal is to bring criminals to justice, his methods often involve bending or even breaking the law.

This vigilante behavior raises ethical concerns as it undermines the principles of due process and the rule of law.

In this scene, Batman resorts to using excessive force and intimidation tactics to extract information from the Joker. He slams the Joker's head onto a table, threatens him with violence, and even dangles him over the edge of a building. While Batman's objective is to obtain crucial information that could save lives, his methods clearly cross the line of acceptable behavior. This scene exemplifies how Batman's vigilante actions undermine the principles of due process and the rule of law. Instead of relying on the legal system to gather evidence and conduct interrogations, Batman takes matters into his own hands, disregarding the rights of the accused. This scene serves as a strong illustration of how Batman's actions, even if driven by a desire for justice, ultimately blur the line between hero and villain, raising ethical concerns about the morality of his character.

node: S-11, text: One key piece of supporting evidence that reinforces the argument that Batman's character takes on a villainous quality in The Dark Knight is the dialogue and character interactions throughout the film. In several instances, Batman engages in conversations that highlight his willingness to operate outside the law. For example, during a conversation with Alfred, his loyal butler and mentor, Batman justifies his actions by stating, "Sometimes the truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more." This dialogue suggests that Batman believes he has the authority to determine what people deserve, bypassing the legal system and taking justice into his own hands. Additionally, his interactions with other characters, such as Commissioner Gordon, reveal a disregard for due process. Instead of working within the confines of the law, Batman often resorts to intimidation and violence, using fear as a means to achieve his objectives. These instances of dialogue and character interactions serve to further blur the line between justice and vigilantism in Batman's actions, ultimately reinforcing the argument that his character takes on a villainous quality in The Dark Knight.

node: CA-136, text: While it can be argued that Batman's actions in The Dark Knight are justified due to moral ambiguity, it is important to consider the potential consequences of such actions. The counter argument suggests that Batman's methods are necessary in order to combat the evil that plagues Gotham City. However, it is crucial to recognize that the blurred line between justice and revenge is a significant factor that supports the notion of Batman's villainous nature. By taking justice into his own hands and resorting to extreme measures, Batman risks becoming the very thing he fights against. This moral ambiguity raises questions about the long-term effectiveness of his actions and whether they truly lead to a just society. While Batman's intentions may be noble, it is essential to critically analyze the implications of his methods and the potential erosion of justice in the pursuit of revenge.

node: dp-373-Actions and behavior of Batman-0, text: In The Dark Knight, Batman's character exhibits a villainous nature through his consistent willingness to take the law into his own hands and bypass the justice system. While Batman may be driven by a desire to protect Gotham City from criminals, his actions often blur the line between heroism and vigilantism. Instead of working within the legal framework and allowing the justice system to take its course, Batman frequently resorts to extreme methods to achieve his goals. This disregard for due process not only undermines the principles of justice but also raises questions about the moral integrity of his character. By assuming the role of judge, jury, and executioner, Batman exhibits a dangerous tendency to wield unchecked power, ultimately mirroring the very villains he seeks to defeat.

node: dp-373-Contrast with traditional heroic characteristics-0, text: One key aspect that sets Batman apart from traditional heroes is his willingness to bend or break the law in order to achieve his goals, which goes against the traditional heroic commitment to upholding justice through legal means. While traditional heroes are often portrayed as virtuous and morally upright, The Dark Knight takes a unique approach by presenting Batman as a character with villainous attributes. This aspect is particularly evident in Batman's vigilantism and his tendency to operate outside the boundaries of the law. Unlike the typical hero who abides by the legal system, Batman sees himself as above the law, believing that his own judgment and methods are necessary to combat crime effectively. This willingness to operate outside the confines of the law raises questions about the nature of justice and the boundaries of heroism, challenging the traditional notion of a hero as a paragon of virtue. By presenting Batman as a character who is not bound by the legal system, The Dark Knight offers a thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of justice and the moral gray areas that heroes can inhabit.

node: CA-5170, text: While some argue that Batman's actions in The Dark Knight are justified by the extent of criminality in Gotham City, it is important to consider the potential dangers of such a perspective. While it is true that Gotham City is plagued by high levels of crime and corruption, it does not necessarily justify Batman's decision to act as judge, jury, and executioner. By taking the law into his own hands, Batman sets a dangerous precedent that undermines the principles of due process and the rule of law. It is essential to remember that no individual, no matter how well-intentioned, should have the unchecked power to determine guilt and deliver punishment. This is a slippery slope that can lead to a society where individuals with power can abuse their authority and become tyrants themselves. Therefore, it is crucial to challenge the notion that Batman's actions are justified solely based on the extent of criminality in Gotham City.

node: S-9960, text: One way to support the argument that Batman exhibits a villainous nature in The Dark Knight is through a character analysis. Throughout the film, Batman consistently takes the law into his own hands and bypasses the justice system. He operates outside the boundaries of the legal framework, which raises concerns about his moral integrity. By assuming the roles of judge, jury, and executioner, Batman exhibits a dangerous tendency to wield unchecked power. This is evident in his extreme methods, such as using fear and intimidation to extract information from criminals. Instead of working within the established system and allowing due process to take its course, Batman chooses to act as a vigilante, blurring the line between heroism and villainy. This disregard for the principles of justice not only undermines the very system he seeks to protect but also mirrors the behavior of the very villains he opposes.

prompt: It turns out that depending on the nature of its implementation, a cryptographic primitive may also spread key-dependent signals on non-purposed side channels, besides the main communication channel on which the ciphertext message is supposed to be broadcast. Those side channels are depicted in Figure 1.2. Inside the electronic device, all the data related to the cryptographic primitive – i.e. the plaintexts, the secret key, the cipher-texts and all the intermediate computations – are stored in the memory, loaded through the bus, and manipulated in the CPU registers, under the physical form of electric signals. All those elements are made of gates whose power consumption depends on the binary data they are supposed to store or to drive. Therefore, depending on the processed data, an oscilloscope can notices light changes in the measured power consumption, so an attacker can monitor this physical measurement to recover some information about the key, and thereby breaking the target device, as shown by Kocher [KJJ99]. A more detailed discussion about this dependency is proposed in Section 3.5. Likewise, any change of value in the data passed through a given gate would result in a change of current in the gate, resulting in the emission of Electro-Magnetic (EM) radiations, which can be monitored thanks to an EM probe [GMO01, QS01].

node: dp-276-Increased transparency, credibility, and accessibility-0, text: When comparing QualiGPT with traditional manual coding methods, it becomes evident that QualiGPT's utilization of the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and its API brings significant enhancements to the qualitative analysis process. Traditional manual coding methods often rely on human coders to manually categorize and analyze qualitative data, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. In contrast, QualiGPT utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to automate the process, providing a more efficient and accurate analysis of qualitative data. This automation not only saves valuable time but also reduces the likelihood of subjective biases that can arise from human interpretation. Moreover, QualiGPT's API allows for increased transparency and credibility in the analysis process. Researchers can access the API to examine and verify the steps taken by the model in analyzing the data, ensuring a higher level of transparency and reproducibility in the findings. Additionally, QualiGPT's API enables researchers to easily share their analysis methods and results with others, enhancing the accessibility of qualitative analysis. Overall, by leveraging GPT technology and its API, QualiGPT offers a valuable alternative to traditional manual coding methods, improving the efficiency, accuracy, transparency, credibility, and accessibility of qualitative data analysis.

prompt: David Holz Fire-side Chat
leap motion couldn't find investors w/ dev kit - only interested in licensing business 
most of effort was in licensing but it's forcing people to like the product 
success was due to building own product and getting it out - getting others to build on top wasn't  necessarily the best idea
VC wanted home runs but not DH; that's why he's going about it the way he is with MJ
Looked at process of creation: reflect on what you are going to do and who you are, imagine how to get there, coordinat eto get there
focused on less on HCI but on three pillars
genai leveraged for this 
worked on three areas 
ran into diffusion 3 years ago 
saw that computer will act as vehicle for mind 
sailboat logo reflecting this 
human is in the driver seat - not replacing but humans are being made better
intrinsically motivated by making people better 
MJ created 3d models but knew it would be too early without other tech
3d on 2d screen is not that crazy 
goal was building lab that does many things b/c thats what inspires DH
drove bank account to zero to start this 
when building image gen, considered tradeoff of quality and responsiveness // do peoke make alone or together
created chatroom, email, sms versions 
created chat to iterate on hyperparamter as a group and decided to user test it and people ended up finding discord more enjoyable 
didn't want to create a social media for distribution so tackled discord*
liked discord since DH coudl see others using the product - learned a lot from it 
30% using it for therapy
people need to explore through play 
people don't want to be lone explorer - MJ has other people to do it with 
HCI advice - don't listen to average user
listen to 
smartest power user
1st time user
middle users aren't as good
Biggest project is building native platform where millions of people can come and build; can even be a few users 
"aesthetic singularity" where everyone is making great pictures with millions of people together and exploring together that is algorithmically existing 
aesthetic hiveminds doing interesting things 
"text is not universal interface"- it's good but not universal
language is virus and we are carriers passing it to children
diff mediums have positives
words are good for random access 
accessing facebook can be done fastest with word
hand tracking is not as good for this
voice isn't as good either
visuals is interesting since some words are hard to describe 
MJ userbase is more of over 35
younger people don't like words 
MJ releasing feature to come up with personal aesthetic using a bunch of image samples and then define an asesctic vector for people to make images that indiviaudls like more 
much more difficult with text, even with pairing 
people can choose pics like needle in a haystack
How do you give right control to users? 
most people don't know what they want - they're about wandering 
want to build for wanderings vs. creation in the traditional sense 
"MJ is the best way to create 1000 images you don't like so you can find one you like" 
it's a reflecting tool to understand what you want 
Midjourney is a community supported AI research  lab 
it's so expensive that other research labs are near zero
Running subscription to get an idea of what capacity needed
people pay for annual subscription 
bought 4x compute capacity of 2023 compute capacity for 2024 just using the money from yearly subscription from this year
uses 10s of thousands of GPUs right now 
would consider open sourcing older technology 
want to achieve craigslist escape velocity
advice for startups
don't start ai company if you don't have an AI lab
need powerful network or UI  
UI can be copied  with billions of dollars so it needs to be good
try to compound value over your life
over the next few years, ai models will get really small 
lots of large labs will go bust 
barriers to entry will become very low
want to see how medium changes for UI
Video and 3d will be natural extension of 2d so no point in starting companies in those two areas specifically (specialty) 
guiding star is creating aesthetic singularity - garnaulr control is not related to this 
people try to integrate AI into current tools, instead, it should be a new, realtime generation that is built on an xbox type of device built for AI 
liquid imagination swirling around the room
"neural water color" where you draw a line and images are formed aroudn it 
let's build the most alien feature

prompt: In many countries, people now wear western-style dresses such as suits and jeans rather than traditional clothing.
Why is this? Is this a positive or negative development?
Why is this? Is this a positive or negative development?
response: Key aspects to discuss in support of the argument:

1. Globalization and cultural exchange: The increased exposure to Western culture through media, travel, and international trade has led to the adoption of Western-style clothing in many countries. This can be seen as a positive development as it promotes cultural exchange and understanding.

2. Modernization and convenience: Western-style clothing, such as suits and jeans, is often associated with modernity and convenience. The practicality and versatility of these clothing options make them popular choices for daily wear. This can be seen as a positive development as it allows people to adapt to changing lifestyles and fashion trends.

3. Professionalism and formal occasions: Western-style clothing, particularly suits, is often considered more formal and professional attire. As countries develop economically and socially, there is an increasing need for individuals to dress in a manner that is deemed appropriate for professional settings and formal occasions. This can be seen as a positive development as it reflects the growing professionalism and global integration of societies.

4. Fashion trends and personal expression: Western-style clothing has become a global fashion trend, and many people choose to wear it as a form of personal expression. The availability of Western fashion brands and the influence of Western celebrities and influencers contribute to the popularity of these clothing styles. This can be seen as a positive development as it allows individuals to express their personal style and creativity.

However, it is important to consider potential negative aspects as well. These may include cultural erosion, loss of traditional identity, and the impact on local textile industries. These aspects should be explored and discussed in order to provide a well-rounded analysis of the topic.

node: CA-642, text: While it is true that Notre Dame prides itself on its commitment to using the highest quality ingredients in every dish, it is important to consider the counter argument related to cost and accessibility. While sustainable and organic food options are commendable, they often come at a higher price point. This can pose a challenge for students who may already be struggling with the high cost of tuition and living expenses. By focusing solely on using the highest quality ingredients, Notre Dame may inadvertently exclude students with limited financial resources from accessing the best food on campus. This raises questions about the inclusivity and affordability of the dining options available to all students, regardless of their financial circumstances. It is crucial to strike a balance between quality and accessibility to ensure that all students can enjoy nutritious and delicious meals on campus.

As the snow melts away and the days grow longer, flowers start to bloom in a riot of colors, transforming the once barren landscape into a breathtaking masterpiece. The sight of cherry blossoms in soft pinks, tulips in bold reds and yellows, and daffodils in vibrant oranges and whites is enough to lift anyone's spirits. These vibrant hues not only bring visual delight but also evoke a sense of joy and positivity. Furthermore, the fragrances that accompany these blooming flowers create a sensory experience like no other. The sweet scent of roses, the delicate aroma of lavender, and the fresh smell of newly cut grass fill the air, creating an enchanting atmosphere that is both invigorating and calming. These vibrant colors and fragrances serve as a reminder of the beauty and resilience of nature, and they further enhance my love for springtime.

Witnessing the graceful flight of migratory birds as they make their way back from their wintering grounds is a truly awe-inspiring sight. It is a reminder of the incredible journeys these birds undertake and the resilience of nature. Furthermore, the return of wildlife after a long winter adds a sense of excitement and anticipation to the season. The sight of animals emerging from hibernation or venturing out to find food and mates is a testament to the cycle of life and the renewal that spring brings. These natural phenomena not only contribute to the overall beauty of spring but also serve as a reminder of the interconnectedness of all living beings.

node: dp-73-Experiences of Filipino migrant nurses-0, text: Socio-political factors play a crucial role in shaping the experiences of Filipino migrant nurses. The socio-political environment in the Philippines, characterized by limited job opportunities, low wages, and a lack of support for the healthcare sector, pushes many nurses to seek employment abroad. The government's failure to address these issues effectively contributes to the exodus of skilled healthcare professionals. Additionally, political instability and corruption further exacerbate the challenges faced by Filipino nurses, as they often encounter bureaucratic hurdles and unethical practices. These socio-political factors not only impact the individual nurses but also have far-reaching implications for the Philippines as a whole. The loss of skilled healthcare workers hampers the country's healthcare system, leading to a shortage of qualified professionals and reduced access to quality healthcare for the population. Furthermore, the remittances sent back by Filipino nurses working abroad play a significant role in the country's economy, highlighting the interconnectedness between socio-political factors and the experiences of migrant nurses.

node: dp-73-Experiences of Filipino migrant nurses-1, text: One of the key factors driving Filipino nurses to migrate is the economic situation in the Philippines. The country has long faced economic challenges, including high unemployment rates and low wages for healthcare professionals. Many Filipino nurses are drawn to countries like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, where they can earn significantly higher salaries and have access to better benefits and working conditions. The economic pull is often so strong that it becomes difficult for these nurses to resist the allure of better financial stability and opportunities for career advancement abroad. This economic factor not only shapes the decisions of individual nurses but also has broader implications for the Philippines as a whole. The exodus of skilled healthcare professionals leaves a significant gap in the healthcare system, leading to decreased access to quality healthcare services for the local population. Additionally, the outflow of remittances from these migrant nurses, which are often sent back to their families in the Philippines, has become a crucial source of income for many households and contributes to the country's overall economy. Therefore, the economic factors driving Filipino nurses to migrate have a profound impact on both the individuals themselves and the Philippines as a whole, highlighting the complex web of historical, economic, and socio-political factors that shape their experiences.

node: dp-73-Experiences of Filipino migrant nurses-0, text: Socio-political factors play a significant role in shaping the experiences of Filipino migrant nurses. The Philippines has long been known for its nursing profession, with a surplus of qualified nurses compared to available job opportunities within the country. This surplus is largely attributed to socio-political factors such as the lack of sufficient healthcare infrastructure, low wages, and limited career advancement opportunities. As a result, many Filipino nurses are compelled to seek better opportunities abroad, often facing challenges such as cultural adjustment, language barriers, and discrimination in their host countries. These experiences not only impact the individual nurses but also have broader implications for the Philippines as a whole. The loss of highly skilled healthcare professionals contributes to the brain drain phenomenon, depleting the country's healthcare workforce and hindering the development of the local healthcare system. Additionally, the remittances sent back by Filipino migrant nurses serve as a crucial source of income for their families and contribute to the country's economy. Thus, examining the socio-political factors that influence the experiences of Filipino migrant nurses is essential in understanding the multifaceted nature of their experiences and the wider implications for the Philippines.

node: dp-73-Experiences of Filipino migrant nurses-1, text: One key aspect to consider when examining the experiences of Filipino migrant nurses is the economic factors that drive them to leave their home country. The Philippines has long been grappling with economic challenges, including high unemployment rates and limited job opportunities, particularly in the healthcare sector. With an oversupply of nursing graduates and a scarcity of job openings, many Filipino nurses are left with few options for stable employment. Consequently, the allure of higher wages and better working conditions abroad becomes increasingly appealing. The decision to migrate is not solely a personal one, but rather one that is influenced by the broader economic implications for the Philippines. The exodus of nurses from the country not only impacts the healthcare system but also has wider consequences on the economy, such as brain drain and a loss of skilled professionals. Thus, understanding the economic factors behind Filipino nurse migration is crucial in comprehending the multifaceted experiences of these individuals and the broader implications for the Philippines as a whole.

node: dp-166-Accuracy and reliability-0, text: The lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes is a crucial aspect that further supports the argument that the utilization of AI in medical imaging poses a significant risk in terms of accuracy and reliability. AI algorithms are complex systems that rely on large datasets and intricate models to make decisions. However, these algorithms often operate as "black boxes," meaning that their decision-making processes are not easily understandable or explainable to humans. This lack of transparency raises concerns regarding the reliability of AI systems in medical imaging. Without clear insight into how the AI arrives at its conclusions, it becomes difficult to trust the accuracy of its diagnoses. Additionally, the inability to understand the reasoning behind an AI's decision makes it challenging to identify and rectify errors or biases that may be present in the algorithm. As a result, the lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes significantly undermines the accuracy and reliability of AI in medical imaging, further reinforcing the argument that it poses a significant risk.

This not only jeopardizes patient privacy but also exposes individuals to potential identity theft and other forms of cybercrime. Therefore, it is imperative for policymakers and healthcare organizations to establish robust guidelines and regulations that address the specific challenges and risks associated with AI medical imaging. These regulations should ensure that patient data is adequately protected, access is restricted to authorized personnel, and mechanisms are in place to mitigate the risks associated with data breaches and cyber threats. By carefully considering and addressing these concerns, we can strike a balance between the benefits of incorporating AI in medical imaging and the protection of patient privacy and data security.

node: dp-166-Legal and regulatory challenges-0, text: One of the key concerns when incorporating AI in medical imaging is the potential liability issues that may arise if AI algorithms make errors or misinterpret images. While AI has shown promise in improving accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging, there is always a possibility of algorithmic errors or biases. In the context of medical imaging, where accurate diagnoses are crucial for patient care, any misinterpretation or error can have serious consequences. If an AI algorithm were to misdiagnose a condition or overlook a critical finding, it could result in delayed or incorrect treatment, potentially leading to patient harm or even death. This raises important questions about the accountability and responsibility for such errors. Who would be held liable - the manufacturer of the AI system, the healthcare provider using the AI technology, or the radiologist who relies on the AI algorithm's interpretation? These potential liability issues highlight the need for robust legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure that accountability is clearly defined and that patients are protected in the event of AI-related errors in medical imaging.

node: CA-1409, text: While some may argue that President Xi's leadership qualities have solidified his reputation as a commendable figure due to his efforts in promoting social stability and unity, it is important to consider the counter argument that highlights the lack of political freedom in China. Despite the progress made in maintaining a harmonious society, President Xi's leadership has been marked by a tightening grip on power, suppressing dissent, and limiting individual freedoms. The absence of political freedom undermines the very essence of exceptional leadership, as it hinders open dialogue, stifles innovation, and prevents the emergence of alternative viewpoints. A truly commendable leader would not only prioritize social stability but also recognize the importance of political freedom and the need for diverse voices in shaping a prosperous and harmonious society. Without political freedom, President Xi's leadership qualities must be critically questioned, as they fail to foster an environment conducive to genuine progress and unity.

node: CA-5208, text: While it is true that GPT has the potential to greatly enhance efficiency in decision-making processes, it is important to consider the counter argument that GPT's adaptability may be limited. While GPT can quickly analyze complex information and provide insights, its ability to adapt to new and unforeseen circumstances may be restricted. Decision-making processes often require flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing conditions. GPT, with its predetermined algorithms and lack of human intuition, may struggle to effectively respond to unforeseen events or unique situations that require creative and adaptive thinking. This limitation could hinder its ability to streamline decision-making processes in industries where adaptability is crucial, such as finance. In such cases, relying solely on GPT's analysis may lead to suboptimal decisions. Therefore, while GPT can undoubtedly enhance efficiency in decision-making, its limited adaptability should be carefully considered before fully relying on it to revolutionize our society.

node: S-3861, text: One key supporting evidence to consider when discussing the limited ability of autonomous vehicles to handle unexpected or complex situations on the road is safety statistics. Safety is a paramount concern when it comes to transportation, and it is essential to analyze the data regarding accidents involving autonomous vehicles. According to recent studies, self-driving cars have been involved in accidents at a higher rate compared to human-driven vehicles. These accidents often occur in situations where the autonomous vehicles struggle to adapt, such as in construction zones or adverse weather conditions. This data suggests that the current technology used in autonomous vehicles is not yet capable of effectively navigating these unpredictable variables, which raises concerns about the safety of both passengers and pedestrians. By considering safety statistics, it becomes evident that the limited ability of autonomous vehicles to handle unexpected situations is a valid argument against their widespread use on our roads.

node: dp-840-Descriptive language-0, text: The use of descriptive adjectives plays a crucial role in creating a sensory experience for the reader. By carefully selecting and incorporating these adjectives into the narrative, authors have the power to evoke a wide range of emotions and engage the reader's senses. For instance, when an author describes a scene as "a tranquil, azure ocean under the golden sun," the reader can almost feel the warmth of the sun on their skin and hear the gentle lapping of the waves. By appealing to the senses, descriptive adjectives enable readers to form a vivid mental image of the scene, making the narrative more immersive and captivating. This immersion allows readers to develop a deeper connection with the story and its characters, as they can visualize the details and experience the events as if they were there themselves. Therefore, the use of descriptive adjectives is an invaluable tool in enhancing the reader's experience and bringing the narrative to life.

While AI has made significant advancements in certain domains, it lacks the ability to make ethical decisions or understand the implications of its actions. Programming, on the other hand, requires human judgment and moral reasoning to navigate complex ethical dilemmas. For example, a programmer may need to consider the potential consequences of an algorithm that collects and analyzes personal data. They must weigh the benefits against the potential risks to privacy and security. This level of ethical decision-making and critical thinking is not easily replicable by AI. Therefore, the indispensability of creativity and problem-solving skills in programming extends to the realm of ethical considerations, making it unlikely that AI will fully replace human programmers in the near future.

This level of adaptability and flexibility is not easily replicable by AI, as it requires human intuition, experience, and the ability to think outside the box. Furthermore, programming is a constantly evolving field, with new technologies and frameworks emerging regularly. Developers must continuously learn and update their skills to stay relevant and effective. This need for ongoing learning and adaptation further highlights the indispensability of human programmers in the face of rapidly changing technologies.

prompt: 二战中最引人入胜的故事之一发生在1940年的敦刻尔克大撤退。当时，盟军在法国北部的敦刻尔克被德军包围，面临着被歼灭的危险。大撤退的计划开始执行，士兵们被紧急调集到海滩上等待撤离。然而，由于德军的猛烈轰炸和艰难的海上条件，敦刻尔克的疏散变得非常困难。
然而，在这关键时刻，一个奇迹般的转折发生了。数以百计的小船和渔船被动员起来，船主们义无反顾地驶向战火纷飞的海滩，希望能够拯救被围困的士兵们。牛津大学的勇敢教授们也参与其中，驾驶着自己的小船为盟军做出贡献。
这段期间，敦刻尔克天空中的英国皇家空军战机与德军展开了激烈的空中战斗，掩护着撤退行动。同时，士兵们在海滩上坚守，不断受到敌军的袭击，但他们坚持下来，直至最后一刻。
最终，几十万名盟军士兵成功撤离敦刻尔克，回到了英伦三岛。这次大撤退虽然遭受了重大损失，但也展现了人类坚韧不拔和无私奉献的精神。二战中的敦刻尔克大撤退成为了一段戏剧性而感人至深的历史故事，永远被铭记在人们心中。

node: dp-92-长城的文化和历史意义-0, text: 长城作为中国历史的见证和纪念，进一步支持了从长城的文化和历史意义的角度来看，秦始皇修长城并没有给大一统带来正面的效果的论点。长城作为一个巨大的工程和国家防御体系，不仅仅是一道军事屏障，更是中国古代文明的象征。长城见证了中国多个朝代的兴衰，承载着无数历史故事和传说。它成为了中国历史的重要标志，代表着中国人民的智慧和勇气。然而，尽管长城的存在体现了中国文化的独特性和历史的延续，秦始皇修长城并没有给大一统带来正面的效果。相反，他的修建过程中导致了大量劳动力和资源的浪费，给人民带来了巨大的负担。此外，长城的修建并没有解决秦朝面临的实际问题，也没有改变中国历史上的分裂局面。因此，从长城作为中国历史的见证和纪念的角度来看，可以说秦始皇修长城并没有给大一统带来正面的效果。

node: dp-92-增加国家的地理边界-0, text: 修建长城可以有效地阻止外部入侵者的侵略，并保护国家的领土完整性。然而，从增加国家的地理边界的角度来看，可以认为秦始皇修长城对大一统没有正面的效果。尽管长城确实在一定程度上提供了防御功能，但它也限制了国家的扩张和发展。长城的存在使得中国的边界变得更加固定，难以适应不断变化的地缘政治形势。这种固定边界的限制可能会导致国家无法充分利用其领土潜力，无法扩大其国际影响力。此外，长城的修建也需要大量的人力、物力和财力投入，这可能会削弱国家在其他领域的发展。综上所述，尽管长城在保护国家领土完整性方面起到了积极的作用，但从整体上考虑，它对于实现大一统可能没有带来正面的效果。

node: dp-92-统一民族-0, text: The focus on building the Great Wall may indeed have diverted resources and attention away from other initiatives that could have fostered unity among different ethnic groups, when considering the perspective of a unified nation. While the construction of the Great Wall was undoubtedly a monumental feat that showcased the power and ambition of the Qin Dynasty, it is important to recognize that it required a significant amount of resources, both human and financial. These resources could have been allocated towards initiatives such as promoting cultural exchange, improving infrastructure, or implementing policies that aimed at integrating different ethnic groups into a cohesive society. By prioritizing the construction of the Great Wall, the Qin Dynasty may have missed an opportunity to address the underlying issues of ethnic diversity and promote a sense of unity among the various ethnic groups within their empire. Thus, from the perspective of unity, it can be argued that the construction of the Great Wall by Qin Shi Huang had limited positive effects on fostering a unified nation.

node: dp-92-统一民族-1, text: The construction of the Great Wall may have indeed reinforced a hierarchical power structure, with the emperor at the top, which could have undermined efforts to create a more egalitarian and inclusive society. By undertaking such a massive construction project, Qin Shi Huang demonstrated his authority and dominance over the people. This display of power could have perpetuated a sense of subordination and obedience among the population, further solidifying the emperor's position at the apex of the social hierarchy. Consequently, this emphasis on hierarchy and unquestioning loyalty to the emperor may have hindered the development of a society that values equality and inclusivity. Rather than promoting a sense of unity among the various ethnic groups within the empire, the construction of the Great Wall may have accentuated the divide between the ruling class and the common people, thus hindering the realization of a more unified nation. In this sense, it can be argued that the construction of the Great Wall did not have a positive impact on the goal of establishing a more unified society from the perspective of a unified nation.

node: dp-92-统一民族-2, text: The discussion point that the Great Wall may have symbolized the dominance and control of the emperor over various ethnic groups, rather than promoting a sense of shared identity and unity, provides valuable insight into the argument that, from the perspective of national unity, Emperor Qin Shi Huang's construction of the Great Wall had no positive effects. The construction of the Great Wall was primarily driven by the emperor's desire to protect his empire from external threats and maintain his power and control over the vast territories under his rule. The wall was a physical manifestation of the emperor's dominance and authority, serving as a symbol of his ability to exert control over different ethnic groups within the empire. This emphasis on control and dominance may have hindered the development of a shared national identity and a sense of unity among the diverse ethnic groups. Instead of fostering a collective identity, the Great Wall may have reinforced divisions and hierarchies within the empire, as different ethnic groups were subjected to the emperor's authority and control. Therefore, it can be argued that the construction of the Great Wall did not contribute positively to the goal of achieving national unity from the perspective of a unified ethnic group.
